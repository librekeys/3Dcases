# 3Dcases

Designs to 3D print enclosures for various raspberry pico and esp32 boards 

## How to contribute your designs

The designs are organized in a directory structure by [brand name]/[board name]/[design name]

To contribute a design you need to submit a pull request to this repository.

If it si for a new board, add a directory structure for that board on the same model as the existing ones. Add a readme files and a picture of the boad in the board level directory

In the board directory, add a sub-directory for your design.

In this directory, add your design files and a README.md file containing : 

- A description of you design and its specificities (look at other designs if you don't know what to write) 

- You copyright notice and the license under which you share your design. If you don't know what license to use, have a look at [Share your work - Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/)

- The software(s) you have used to create the design

- The type of assembly the case has been designed for :
  
  - clip-on
  
  - glue
  
  - screws
  
  - solder
  
  - 

Do not add only STL / 3MF files. Add the real source files of the design you have created with your 3D software so that other people can customize it to their needs.

Do not use spaces or special characters in directory or file names
